PrimeBot is a betting bot for the website PrimeDice. It is an unfinished project which has bugs and should not be used if you are betting real money. The bot has been tested only with the faucet(a small amount of btc that you can claim for free from the website). 

In order to use the bot you need to enter your api key on top of send.py. I do not collect information or credentials from the users of the bot. 

<strong>NOTICE:</strong> The script has no comments, is poorly written with a lot of mistakes and it isn't focused on performance because it was written back when I first started coding.
<strong>NOTICE:</strong> color.pyc is used only to print colored output in the console
